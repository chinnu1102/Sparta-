# Step Functions

Sparta is designed to facilitate all serverless development strategies. While it provides
an AWS Lambda optimized framework, it is also possible to deploy Lambda-free workflows comprised
of [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

For examples of AWS Step Function workflows, see the overviews at:

* [AWS Lambda-based Step Functions](./lambda)
* [AWS Fargate Step Functions](./fargate)

  Reference information is provided in the [services](./services) section.
